## How we calculate the input for the MVP 
First we multiply your BCH score with a 1 when you have a Badge on the scoreboard, with 2 if you also enabled the Push & PR and with 3 if you have 'Gone all the way' ;-) : 1) a Badge on the scoreboard, 2)enabled Push & PR 3)you have test code. 
Finaly we devide by 10. The final score will between 0 and 3.0
